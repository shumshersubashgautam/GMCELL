# Data
The [BBBC021 | Human MCF7 cells â€“ compound-profiling experiment](https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/BBBC021) dataset is used in this project. 

The dataset has been post-processed, s.t. each single cell image has been split into smaller segments. Each segment contains 1 cell. 
However, a few segmented image contain multiple cells due to the proximity in the original image.
